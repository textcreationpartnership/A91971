            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>ROOM FOR Miracles and Reliques, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THough Reason tell us, that only New Revelations want New Miracles to Evidence them Divine. And holy Scripture Teaches, That the Doctrine of the Gospel stands not in need of any further Miracles, since it hath long since been so sufficiently Confirmed: That if an Angel from Heaven should Teach otherwise, and offer Miracles to Vouch his Doctrine, he were worthy to be Accursed; yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to prop up her Traditions, pretends these Miraculous Operations to be far more frequent now, than in the Primitive Times: Well may the Hereticks (saith she) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Miracles Ceased, being conscious of their own dull Inefficacy and confessed Disability to perform them, whilst the Catholick Church has in all Ages given visible Marks of her Infallible Authority, and Unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Jurisdiction, by multitudes of Incredible, as well as unpara<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>lel'd Miracles.</p>
            <p>Of these wonderful Operations, that certainly deserves to Lead the Van (though ordinarily and constantly wrought) which every pitiful Hedg Priest by virtue of his Office, dares chal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151675:3"/> nor tasted, but plain common Wafers still. For not believing this heap of Absurdities, how many Thousands have suffered cruel Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom?</p>
            <p>In the next place deservedly Marches St. <hi>Francis</hi> (Christs Standard-bearer they call him, and Jesus Typical) Heaven and Earth are fill'd with Astonishment at his Wonders: What should we Talk of his puny Miracles, as instructing of a Sheep to go to Church with him, to kneel devoutly there, and bear a part when he Sung the sacred Anthems: Of his swallowing a Spider at Mass, which crept out again whole at his Thigh: Of Water fetcht in an instant out of a Rock, for an Honest man that had lent him an Ass (for you know one good Turn requires another;) or of a Lock of his Hairlaid in the Crack of a Wall, which made up the Breach without Morter. It would be endless to stand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing his Stock of Miracles, since the History of his wonderful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitys to Christ, lately published with great Authority, doubts not to tell you in gross, that whatever Christ did, <hi>Francis</hi> has done the same: And that he has Transcended Christ in his Miracles. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour turned some few Vessels of water into Wine, but <hi>Francis</hi> turned a whole Fountain so.

            <p>Saint <hi>Brendan,</hi> for seven long years together, celebrated his <hi>Easter</hi> upon a <hi>VVhales</hi> back, which he at first mistook for an Island; But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Error, with a prayer or two he fixed the Sea monster from start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at last VVhipt and Spur'd him as far as the Earthly Paradize; from whence (as Luck would have it) they both came safe home.

Another time signing a new born infant with a Cross, she caused the Child to disown its supposed Father, and cry out a loud. <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Broen <hi>is not my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but yonder poor man that fits at the lower end of the Table:</hi> Truly I think the Child was almost as Miraculous as the Saint, that he could know his own Father so readily; If the sign of the Cross did retain the same <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To conclude, who would willingly cross the <hi>Alps,</hi> though always Perriwig'd with Snow, barefoot in a devout Pilgrimage, to see that holy building of our <hi>Ladies Chappel,</hi> That (God knows why or when) travelled Miraculously two thousand miles at one Stage, all through the Air, from <hi>Palestina</hi> to <hi>Loretto,</hi> or to behold a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand more notable Monuments of both Ancient and Modern Saints, and their Sacred Reliques; As St. <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Breeches (And if you please <hi>Lipsius,</hi> his that he offered to our <hi>Lady</hi> too Boot) St. <hi>Anns</hi> Comb, <hi>Judas</hi> his Lanthorn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but especially who would not be greedy to view those Immortal Reliques, The Feather of the Angel <hi>Gabriel;</hi> and the Red Velvet <hi>Buckler,</hi> still reserved in a Castle in <hi>Normandy,</hi> which the Arch-Angel <hi>Michael</hi> made use of when he Combated the <hi>Dragon:</hi> In all which Monuments, there is not so much Miracle in their Preservation, as in their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural <hi>Multiplication,</hi> That the same Cross which <hi>Simon of Cyrene</hi> bore on his back, should now be able to <hi>Load a Ship.</hi> And whereas <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> lost but one Head, there are now two to be seen, one at <hi>Amyens</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> the other at St. <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesters</hi> Abbey in <hi>Rome;</hi> And these both whole. Besides, a multitude of Parcels and Fragments of it elsewhere.</p>
            <p>But of all this we may have a Reason in the Story of the <hi>Nails,</hi> wherewith our Saviour was fastned to the Cross; at first they were but three in all, and <hi>Constantine</hi> caused one of them to be put in his Horse Bridle which he used in the Wars; the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> in his Helmet to stick his Plum of Feathers in; The <hi>Third</hi> he flung into the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driatique</hi> Sea, in a Tempest to Calm the Raging Waves: yet now in <hi>Several Churches,</hi> you shall see a <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o the Sea, took upon it the Nature of a Fish and Spawn'd a great many other <hi>little Nails,</hi> which has produced this multitude. And now I hope your Curiosity is satisfied in the Point.</p>
            <p>Further you are to know that all those Holy Reliques, you have their peculiar Miracles, as the Saints above have their peculiar Imployments. For as the <hi>Heathen Romans,</hi> Erected Temples to the <hi>Green Sickness</hi> and <hi>Ague</hi> for want of Wit: So these <hi>Catholick Romans</hi> for want of <hi>Grace,</hi> have suited their Canonized Patrons to all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. Thus on St. <hi>Johns</hi> day, they implore that Saint for a Blessing for their <hi>Wine,</hi> St. <hi>Stephen</hi> looks after their <hi>Pastures.</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> their Corn, and for <hi>Sea-Deities</hi> they have made good store to pray to, least some of them should not be at leisure, or otherwise imployed in that vast Element: As St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> St. <hi>Clement,</hi> St. <hi>Nicholas, &amp;c.</hi> So that certainly if the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven do know what is now faigned of them on Earth; and could be capable of <hi>Hmuane Affections,</hi> in that blessed Region of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility,</hi> they would Blush for shame at such <hi>Prodigious Fables,</hi> and as <hi>Socrates</hi> when he read <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dialogues, cry'd out, <hi>Quam Multa de me mentitur Adolescens.</hi> So surely would they say, <hi>How many gross and abominable Lyes, do those Idle Cloysterer's raise of us.</hi> But by this <hi>Craft we get</hi> our <hi>Living,</hi> cry the <hi>Popish D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These Stories were all raised to Cheat the Common people, first of their <hi>VVits,</hi> and then of <hi>Money,</hi> and creat an esteem for the Priests and Monks, as Instrumental in these Miracles, and having all the Sacred <hi>VVonderworking</hi> Reliques in their Custody: Whereas indeed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their Brags of Miracles, most true is that Blunt <hi>Repartae</hi> of

               <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> to <hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth (whom he found surrounded with vast Heaps of Gold) Loe! <hi>Thomas,</hi> saith the Pope, The Church cannot now say as of Old, <hi>Silver and Gold have I none:</hi> No truly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the <hi>surly Doctor.</hi> Neither can she say to the Lame man, <hi>Arise and walk.</hi> Considering the great Dishonour of God and sincere Religion, with the danger poor deluded Souls are drawn into by such Impostures of the Romish Clergy, we hope we may without offence, conclude this Sheet with a <hi>Story</hi> borrowed from Father <hi>Bromiard</hi> (a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and therefore we hope an undeniable Author) which if it should be true, not a few poor Ignorant Lay-papists, that use to Reverence their cheat-<hi>Priests</hi> as Demy-Deitiyes, will certainly think it a greater Miracle than any we have yet related. And thus it is: A certain Priest returning Home one Night very late from an <hi>Harlot,</hi> which he kept Abroad (to do, which the <hi>Cannons</hi> vote less Criminal by far, then to have an honest Wife) hearing a most lamentable Noise of a <hi>Ghost</hi> not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>LEst any should Dream we Coyn any Stories here on purpose to make Popery <hi>Rediculous,</hi> we assure them we have taken all from <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals,</hi> where they are told with no little <hi>Seriousness</hi> and <hi>Gravity,</hi> as in the <hi>Golden Legend, John Capgrave, Speculum Exemplorum,</hi> the Book of <hi>Conformities,</hi> and such other worthy Catholick Monuments.</p>
            <p>And lest any should fancy that the old <hi>Beldam</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is grown Barren, and accuse us for telling more but <hi>stale</hi> Miracles, <hi>Fortune</hi> has just now supplied us with a <hi>fresh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:</hi> For the very last <hi>Harleem Currant,</hi> comes News from <hi>Rome</hi> of the 9th. of <hi>Dec.</hi> That two <hi>Maids</hi> are there found with Child. And who can doubt that to be a Miracle? Especially when they had solemnly vow'd Virginity, and were Cloistered up in a <hi>Nunnery:</hi> However the <hi>Pope</hi> considering humane frailty, and remembring it was only a <hi>Venial</hi> Sin, thought fit to Impose no other <hi>Penance</hi> on them then a gentle <hi>Flogging</hi> or <hi>Whipping</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
